Hi! I'm Zee (They/them), or Zeerak Talat (I used to go by Zeerak Waseem)! I'm a Chancellor's Fellow (~Assistant Professor in the U.S.) in Responsible Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence at the [Centre for Technomoral Futures](http://technomoralfutures.uk) and [the School of Informatics](https://informatics.ed.ac.uk), where I am a member of the [Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc), at the University of Edinburgh, and I have recently joined [DAIR](https://www.dair-institute.org) as a faculty fellow.
I work on the intersection between machine learning, science and technology studies, and media studies.
My research centres decolonial and anti-capitalist critiques of ML and providing evidence that current ML methods (i.e., the mathematics of it all) are constructed in a way that naturally afford authoritarianism, colonialism, and forms of hegemony (i.e., white supremacy, patriarchy, ableism, and so on) and thinking about and developing ML methods that rethink the ways in which ML is applied to offer resistance to such notions.
I did my undergrad in Computer Science and my master's in IT & Cognition (with [Dirk Hovy](dirkhovy.com)) at the University of Copenhagen, and my Ph.D. (with [Kalina Bontcheva](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/people/academic/kalina-bontcheva)), and have done two post-docs at the [Digital Democracies Institute](https://digitaldemocracies.org), and [Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence](mbzuai.ac.ae).
You can find me raising issues with machine learning on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ZeerakTalat) and [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@zeerak).
I'm always looking for interesting people to work with, so do send me an e-mail at z[at]zeerak[dot]org.

Google scholar hates name changes so looking for my publications page is not gonna be helpful. This is a large issue that particular affects trans scholars. You can [sign a petition here](https://scholar.hasfailed.us/). If you want to find citation counts and so on, you can find them on my [Semantic Scholar Page](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Zeerak-Talat/2138053020).
