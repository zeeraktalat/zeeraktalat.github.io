My name is Zeerak Talat (I used to go by Zeerak Waseem), a Chancellor's Fellow (~Assistant Professor in the U.S.) in Responsible Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence at the [Centre for Technomoral Futures](http://technomoralfutures.uk) and [the School of Informatics](https://informatics.ed.ac.uk), where I am a member of the [Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc), at the University of Edinburgh, and I am one of the 2024 visiting research fellows at [HIIG](https://hiig.de/), and have recently joined [DAIR](https://www.dair-institute.org) as a faculty fellow.
I work on the intersection between machine learning, science and technology studies, and media studies.
My research seeks to examine how machine learning systems interact with our societies and the downstream effects of introducing machine learning to our society.
I did my undergrad in Computer Science and the University of Copenhagen, and my master's in IT & Cognition (with [Dirk Hovy](dirkhovy.com)), and recently finished my Ph.D. (with [Kalina Bontcheva](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/people/academic/kalina-bontcheva)), and have done two post-docs at the [Digital Democracies Institute](https://digitaldemocracies.org), and [Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence](mbzuai.ac.ae).
You can find me raising issues with machine learning on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ZeerakTalat) and [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@zeerak).
I'm always looking for interesting people to work with, so do send me an e-mail at z[at]zeerak[dot]org.

Google scholar hates name changes so looking for my publications page is not gonna be helpful. This is a large issue that particular affects trans scholars. You can [sign a petition here](https://scholar.hasfailed.us/). If you want to find citation counts and so on, you can find them on my [Semantic Scholar Page](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Zeerak-Talat/2138053020).
