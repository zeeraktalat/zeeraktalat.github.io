# For Workshop Organisers

## Submitting Your Proposal

For \*ACL workshop and LREC-COLING there are now templates to follow. Please use these as it makes it easier to ensure that all information has been filled in when submitting a proposal, and for the reviewers it makes it easier to compare submissions with one another. Please refer to the respective calls for workshops to find the templates.

### Notes for All Workshops

#### Colocation

Note that when you submit a workshop proposal, you can order your preference in which conferences you wish to be colocated with. This however, is simply a request and you should not expect that it is necessarily held. However, there may be particular reasons that your workshop *cannot* be colocated with a conference, and you should specify this. *Without this information, you may have your workshop assigned to a conference that you are unable to host a workshop at (for whatever reason)*.

#### Diversity

Simply stating that the reviewing pool is diverse is not enough.
When we are talking about diversity, we do not mean diversity between academia and industry.
In particular when talking about diversity, we mean that there is a focus on diversity in the invited speakers (past and planned), the organising committee, the fields that are covered e.g. also having social scientists or linguists submit. 
This is in addition to diversity between academia and industry and the reviewing pool.
The point here is that simply highlighting on area does not cover what we understand by diversity.
Certain workshop topics are inherently diversity focused which should be highlighted.
For instance, when workshops are addressing questions such as low-resource languages or creating a space for different fields/disciplines to meet, the topic of the workshop itself is focused on a form of diversity.

If you are only able to show diversity along parameters of academia & industry and seniority, you're a step behind workshops that take the diversity question seriously. The point here isn't that industry/academia diversity isn't important, simply that in my opinion, it is not at all enough compared to what many workshops are doing now.

Having said that *do* highlight topics of diversity that are inherent to the topic or focus of the workshop (that year). e.g., A workshop on summarisation that is focusing on summarisation and simplification for people with reading comprehension difficulties should absolutely highlight that the topic of the workshop is intrinsically linked to diversity in the field (back this up by inviting experts to speak on the topic).

##### Do not have an organising committee that is entirely homogenous

That is, try to diversity the committee along all possible lines: Make sure not everyone is from industry (all academic is better IMHO), make sure it's not all men or all women (the latter being better IMHO), or that every organiser is not based on the same continent (tbf this is only a US issue â€“ basically all workshops with organisers from any other continent have organisers in multiple continents). The organising committee is the number one place where you can show that you're doing things for diversity.

##### Some really cool examples of diversity initiatives I've seen in proposals

These are all shared with permission of course and noting here where I first saw it.

- Inviting local junior academics (assistant profs) working on the topic as keynote speakers - First seen at BioNLP.
- Using the (SIGACCESS)[http://www.sigaccess.org] guidelines for considering access - First seen at XXXX.
- Mentorship of junior researchers from under-represented groups - First seen at WiNLP.
- Breakout groups between junior and senior researchers from industry and academia - First seen at WiNLP.
- Building relationships at HBCUs in the US for disseminating calls - First seen at WOAH.
- Making workshop materials freely available - First seen at the BigPicture Workshop.

Workshops with good D&I sections:
- KnowFM: Towards Knowledgeable Foundation Models

#### Description of Workshop Organizers' Experience

The description of each workshop organizer should seek to answer two questions: 1) How does the organizer's research experience relate to the workshop (e.g., listing areas of research) and 2) what organizational experience does an organizer have (e.g., academic service, organizing academic events, public events such as NLP meetups, etc.).

An organizer's academic history (i.e., where they got their degrees or where they have held positions) is less relevant information.

#### Invited Speakers

Please, for the love of God, provide short bios of the invited speakers. This allows the reviewing committee to evaluate whether the invited speakers indeed are a good match or not. _This is actually important_.

#### Accuracy of information

Provide accurate information. This should go without saying, but give the number of submissions that were received in previous years (this is an evaluation criteria but the evaluators are the community). 
Tell us how many people were physically in the room (this is *not* an evaluation criteria, but it is important to allocate appropriately sized rooms for workshops).

Workshops are not a popularity contest. Workshops focusing on genuinely far-from-the-norm topics are evaluated equally with other workshops, whether 5 or 50 submissions were received. But if you have a workshop on a topic that sees a steady decrease in submissions, or have a workshop that focuses on a popular topic but very few submissions, then I would personally count that against the workshop (I.e., do some work to address this for instance by expanding the scope or having a particular theme of the workshop). But please provide accurate information, without which there is no basis for evaluation and no basis always provides room for negative evaluation.


#### Unsettled Topics

Some years, there are not a lot of spaces for workshops and it is the smallest things that make the difference. So for that reason, I would recommend *not* describing things that are not settled. For instance, if you are planning a shared task, but do not have a chair to organise the shared task, it would be better simply not to list it. The exception to this rule are speakers and panels: Do note who you have reached out to, whether they have responded or not.

#### Developments/Unique Proposal

One thing that is highly considered is whether a workshop is bringing a new perspective - this goes for new and recurring workshops in slightly different ways.

*New Workshops:* For new workshops, an emphasis of the proposal should be what topics/space the workshop offers that hasn't been addressed thus far.

*Recurring Workshops:* For recurring workshops, they should emphasise how they innovate over previous iterations. This can be in terms of the theme of the workshop, the topics addressed, etc.

### New Workshops

For new workshops, finding out exactly what is being looked for in workshop proposals, and in my experience it is useful to focus on what gaps the workshop seeks to close.
If there are competing workshops, then what isn't being offered in them or why it's necessary with multiple workshops in the area (i.e., the area is so popular/has so many nuances that a single workshop isn't enough).

### Recurring Workshops

When you're at this point you should know how to write a workshop proposal, but here are helpful areas to focus on:

- Were your past workshops a success (how many submissions/accepted papers)?
- Why is the workshop still relevant?
- How is the proposed workshop edition innovating on past editions (e.g., focus, topic, new initiative like a shared task, etc.)
- How have you addressed the issue of diversity in the field before? [See some guidance here.](#note-for-all-workshops:-**Diversity**)
- Is your program committee more or less settled?
- Is your timeline (with any new additions) realistic? How can you make it realistic if it is not?

## Organising Workshops

Organising a workshop can be roughly split into N large tasks:

1. Recruiting/Organising reviewers
2. Getting submissions
3. Decision-making for accepted/rejected papers
3. Obtaining Sponsorships
4. Preparing the proceedings.

### Reviewing
#### Recruiting Reviewers

This step should be taken *early* and reviewers are generally a trustworthy bunch in terms of getting reviews in, but collecting a large enough program committee that can address all of the submissions can be a time consuming tasks, so it should be started early, and there should be plans for emergency reviewers.

#### Review Timeline

Typically between 14-30 days is enough time for reviewing. It is useful to ask some reviewers to be emergency reviewers designated before the review process begins, as there are always reviewers who do not finish their reviews and you will therefore need to do it.

#### Reviewer Management Guide

- Invite reviewers via softconf
- E-mail them with reminders to review: Typically 7 days and 3 days before the deadline is enough, though sometimes you also need to remind on the day of the review deadline.
- For people who have not responded or left a review by the day before the deadline: E-mail them individually and ask for whether they can complete the reviews. 
- On the day before the submission deadline, start reaching out to your emergency reviewers.

### Getting Submissions

Obtaining submissions is in large effects a matter of how much the community is aware of the workshop. To this end, make sure to announce the workshop and submission dates are publicised across social media (Twitter being the primary one) and mailing list.

An incomplete list of mailing lists (please e-mail me if any list is missing): Corpora, Linglist (AKA Linguist List), ACL Mailing list (automated after making an event on the ACL portal), SIG\* (many of the special interest groups have mailing lists that it's worth posting in). For more social science-y workshops it can also make sense to send a call to the Association of Internet Research (AOIR) mailing list.

Make sure to send out several calls, and highlight any changed information (e.g., deadline extensions).

### Camera Ready

It is typically a good idea to give authors ~10 days to address reviews. Decisions are also useful to make on the basis of whether the issues raised in the review can be addressed in that span of time.
After authors have uploaded their camera ready versions, you should check them to make sure that they adhere to the ACL style. If they do not, help the authors address the issues for compliance.

#### Uploading videos/papers to Underline/Conference Platform

The folks who are running the virtual platform will need to know the submission ID for each paper that you accept. This will typically you will be requested the following information in a spreadsheet for each paper:

- [Mandatory] Submission ID: The Softconf/OpenReview submission ID.
- [Mandatory] Title: Title of each papers.
- [Mandatory] Type: Talk/Poster.
- [Optional] Chair: First name, Second name (if different from organizer): Can leave this blank.
- [Mandatory] Do you need a virtual space in GatherTown (Yes/No): If it's a poster and will be presented virtually, the answer is most likely 'Yes'.
- [Mandatory] Requires Zoom link (Yes/No): Default answer is "Yes" for all in-person talks and virtual talks. The Zoom is managed and recorded by the conference provider.
- [Optional] Self-provided zoom link: If you are using your own Zoom link, provide it here.

For the Gathertown and Zoom questions, only one link will be produced for each but *do* answer in all rows, to make sure that all papers are correctly assigned by the virtual conference platform.

#### Uploading videos, posters, and/or slides

The virtual conference provider will set a deadline for uploading the content. This is a hard deadline that *must* be taken into account when planning the workshop schedule.

**Recommendation**

I would recommend that you have every presenter create a poster *and* a video presentation. This is more work for the authors before the conference, but it means that both talks and posters are treated equally after the workshop has concluded.

## Building Proceedings

It is important that workshop organizers know one single thing: Any delay from one workshop delays the proceedings for the main conference and all other workshops. For this particular thing, delays are unacceptable.

### Softconf vs. Openreview

I have a preferance for softconf, but regardless of choice, make sure to add the workshop chairs as admins of the workshop submission site. This will help if there are any time-sensitive issues.

### Software

We use [ACLPUB2](https://github.com/rycolab/aclpub2). Using ACLPUB that is built into softconf has been deprecated. While ACLPUB2 is still very new and currently in active development and has some bugs, this is the process that will be used moving forward. Do report bugs as you find them, and ideally, create pull requests for any bugs that you fix.

### Required items:
- A schedule: Manually defined in `program.yml`
- A list of papers: Automatically generated (from the script fetching data) and stored in `papers.yml`.
- A description of the workshop: Manually defined in `description.yml`.
- A list of organizers: Manually defined  in `organizing_committee.yml`
- A list of prefaces: Manually defined in prefaces.yml

#### Notes
The only date format that is accepted is: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`

A common source of errors in the proceedings is missing or incorrect syntax. For instance, I spent an entire day only to find out that in `program.yml`, if you specify the paper IDs that go into each session, then the format is:

```
papers:
  - id: <ID>
```

NOT
```
papers:
  id: <ID>
```

And sadly, the error messages are not always super helpful.

I would use the typical debugging process:
- Identify a minimal working set
- Keep adding information to it until it breaks
- Fix the break
- Add the rest of the information.

If a bug appears, or something could be improved, submit a bug report and create pull requests once you've fixed it.

##### Schedule: `program.yml`

Should contain:
- Different sessions
- Start/End times of each session
- IF papers are already assigned to a session, include them but if not, simply do not list them.
- IDs need to be in text quotes to match up with the IDs in `papers.yml`.

##### Papers: `papers.yml`
Tasks:
- Manually go over each paper and make sure that no formatting issues (e.g., all characters are displayed correctly).
- IDs need to be in text quotes.
- Unarchived papers should be flagged with 'archived: False'.
  - This includes Findings papers to be presented.
- Authors can be tricky people to deal with: So make sure that all author lists in `papers.yml` reflects the author lists in the PDF. A reasonable person would expect that authors would make sure that their own information was correct. A reasonable person would also be wrong.

###### Findings Papers
All findings papers presented at the workshop need to be added to `papers.yml` to be included.

Recommendation: As all papers in `papers.yml` need to have an ID, I would recommend giving each finding paper alphanumeric IDs, starting with `F1` to `F[n]`.

#### Description: `description.yml`
Should contain:
- date & start time of the workshop.
- title of the workshop (including Workshop number).
- chair: Name of each chair without affiliation.
- location: Filled in by workshop chairs.
- id: `workshop_<workshop_[number]>` (e.g., `workshop_1`)
- url: Webpage for the workshop
- abstract: A brief description of the workshop (2-3 sentences).

##### Prefaces: `prefaces.yml`
The format of the file is:
```
- title: <Section Heading>
- file: <Path to file>
```

The title will be used as the section heading in the compiled proceedings, so if you would a sectioned titled  "Introduction" that is defined in `introduction.tex` located in the `prefaces/` directory. Your `prefaces.yml` should look like this:

```
- title: "Introduction"
- file: "prefaces/introduction.tex"
```

All files will be included in the proceedings.tex file, so there is no need for begin/end document or a preamble. Simply have the content in the file.

#### Automatically populating files

1. Create webservices (Manager dropdown -> Other Tools -> Webservices) on softconf for reviewer and submission information (softconf output should be CSV files).
2. Copy the `softconf` directory over to the workshop repository.
3. Edit the config.json files with the appropriate information.
4. Run `softconf2aclpub.py`.

#### Manual steps

1. Populate program.yml.
2. Populate prefaces.yml and create the appropriate tex files.
3. Add the flag `archival: false` to all papers that are non-archival
4. Remove all references to `attachments` where the attachment is `<submission number>.txt`.
5. Add all findings papers to be presented, set the ID to `F<number>`.
6. Ensure all ID numbers in `id` are strings.
7. Verify the contents of all generated files.
8. Check that `organizing_committee.yml` is generated with the organizers' information.
9. Remove 'chairs' from `program_committee.yml`.
10. Check all files for unicode issues (search for `\x`).
11. Fill in the `description.yml` file.

#### Compiling the Proceedings

Clone the [ACLPUB2](https://github.com/rycolab/aclpub2) repository and the workshop Github repository into the same root directory. The structure should look like this:

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ root_folder (e.g., ~/Documents)
| â”œâ”€â”€ aclpub2
| â”œâ”€â”€ workshop_repo
```

Create a virtual environment for building the proceedings and installing python packages.
Personally, I use virtualenv, so my instructions are for that but use any you like.

Go to the aclpub2 directory (and subdirectories) and install all packages.
Add: `export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/aclpub2"` to your virtual environment definition file (e.g., for virtualenv, the file is `venv_dir/bin/activate`)

Sometimes, the proceedings scripts or `softconf2aclpub.py` will fail because of different field names, this should be manually addressed in the appropriate tool.

Steps:

1. Make sure to be in the workshop directory's root.
2. Run `/path/to/aclpub2/bin/generate . --proceedings --overwrite`
3. ??? (bugfix)
4. Check the compiled proceedings for (certain) issues using [ACLPubCheck](https://github.com/acl-org/aclpubcheck)
5. Profit.

##### ACLPubCheck

[ACLPubCheck](https://github.com/acl-org/aclpubcheck) is a tool is developed to identify issues with the submitted camera ready PDFs once the proceedings have compiled.
What this tool checks for is things like formatting issues and font issues. This means that it is run after the proceedings have been compiled and compilation issues will therefore not be caught by it.
Moreover, this does not capture issues like: Missing metadata (e.g., not all authors being listed in the YAML file), missing papers in the proceedings PDF, or accidentally added papers in the proceedings PDF (e.g., Findings papers that are accidentally included in the proceedings rather than just the program).
This is a super helpful tool and the person building the proceedings absolutely should use it.

##### Delivering the proceedings
Each workshop will get a Github repository where all files (PDFs and metadata) are to be uploaded to. These repositories will be created by the conference and each workshop will be provided access to the github users that they provide to the workshop chairs for their conference.
An example repository will be made available for viewing soon.


##### Generating Information for Underline

Once all YAML files have been created, you can then pull out the information needed Underline (with the exception of type of talk and paper ID) using the following script (courtesy of Rob van der Goot) to add to the spreadsheet:

```
data = yaml.safe_load(open('WNUT_data.yml'))

for paper in data:
Â  Â  abstract = paper['abstract']
Â  Â  title = paper['title']
Â  Â  output = [title, abstract]
Â  Â  for author in paper['authors']:
Â  Â  Â  Â  first_name = author['first_name']
Â  Â  Â  Â  second_name = author['last_name']
Â  Â  Â  Â  email = ' ' if 'emails' not in author else author['emails']
Â  Â  Â  Â  output.extend([first_name, second_name, email])
Â  Â  print('\t'.join(output))
```

## For Workshop Chairs and Conference Organisers

The very first bit of advice that I can offer is: Create a google group for all communication with workshop chairs. It streamlines information a lot and it makes it a lot easier. I *cannot* recommend this enough.

### Deadlines

There are some deadlines that are soft and others are hard. It is usually helpful to workshop organizers if the proceedings & video upload deadlines are pushed back, since these are often what influences submission and camera ready deadlines.

- Proceedings deadline: There's a whole project here with getting
- Paper & Video upload (e.g. on Underline)
  - This includes a spreadsheet with paper information for each paper and each workshop.
- Submitted papers deadline

### ISBN

The information needed to generate ISBNs is incredibly simple: The title of the proceedings for each workshop. This can be obtained quite early on, so that once main conference proceedings ISBNs are ready to be requested, the workshop ones can be ready. I would suggest creating a spreadsheet early and sending it out, the titles of proceedings should be checked against this spreadsheet.

### Proceedings

Developing the proceedings and dealing with workshops can be a time-consuming and error prone task. Make sure to suggest that workshop chairs dedicate time *at least* 1 week in advanced of submission. This also means that the camera ready deadline needs to be at least 8 days before the proceedings deadline.
Proceedings cannot be generated until workshop chairs create the github repositories, so create these early and give access to all workshop chairs.
