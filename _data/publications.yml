This prioritization, however, has resulted in concerns with respect to the rights of data subjects represented in data collections, particularly when considering the difficulty in interrogating these collections due to insufficient documentation and tools for analysis. Mindful of these pitfalls, we present our methodology for a documentation-first, human-centered data collection project as part of the BigScience initiative. We identified a geographically diverse set of target language groups (Arabic, Basque, Chinese, Catalan, English, French, Indic languages, Indonesian, Niger-Congo languages, Portuguese, Spanish, and Vietnamese, as well as programming languages) for which to collect metadata on potential data sources. To structure this effort, we developed our online catalogue as a supporting tool for gathering metadata through organized public hackathons. We present our development process; analyses of the resulting resource metadata, including distributions over languages, regions, and resource types; and our lessons learned in this endeavor.},\n	urldate = {2022-03-07},\n	journal = {arXiv:2201.10066 [cs]},\n	author = {McMillan-Major, Angelina and Alyafeai, Zaid and Biderman, Stella and Chen, Kimbo and De Toni, Francesco and Dupont, Gérard and Elsahar, Hady and Emezue, Chris and Aji, Alham Fikri and Ilić, Suzana and Khamis, Nurulaqilla and Leong, Colin and Masoud, Maraim and Soroa, Aitor and Suarez, Pedro Ortiz and Talat, Zeerak and van Strien, Daniel and Jernite, Yacine},\n	month = jan,\n	year = {2022},\n	note = {arXiv: 2201.10066},\n	annote = {Comment: 8 pages plus appendix and references},\n	file = {arXiv Fulltext PDF:/Users/zeeraktalat/Zotero/storage/DBPUWMKR/McMillan-Major et al. - 2022 - Documenting Geographically and Contextually Divers.pdf:application/pdf;arXiv.org Snapshot:/Users/zeeraktalat/Zotero/storage/SVLMNX4X/2201.html:text/html},\n}",

In this context, previous work has demonstrated the sensitivity of these data sets. For instance, potential societal biases in this data are likely to be encoded and to be amplified in the models we deploy. In this work, we draw from developments in the field of history and take a novel perspective on these problems: considering datasets and models through the lens of historical fiction surfaces their political nature, and affords re-configuring how we view the past, such that marginalized discourses are surfaced. Building on such insights, we argue that contemporary methods for machine learning are prejudiced towards dominant and hegemonic histories. Employing the example of neopronouns, we show that by surfacing marginalized histories within contemporary conditions, we can create models that better represent the lived realities of traditionally marginalized and excluded communities.},\n	urldate = {2023-01-18},\n	publisher = {arXiv},\n	author = {Talat, Zeerak and Lauscher, Anne},\n	month = oct,\n	year = {2022},\n	note = {arXiv:2210.06245 [cs]},\n}

While these capabilities have led to widespread adoption, most LLMs are developed by resource-rich organizations and are frequently kept from the public. As a step towards democratizing this powerful technology, we present BLOOM, a 176B-parameter open-access language model designed and built thanks to a collaboration of hundreds of researchers. BLOOM is a decoder-only Transformer language model that was trained on the ROOTS corpus, a dataset comprising hundreds of sources in 46 natural and 13 programming languages (59 in total). We find that BLOOM achieves competitive performance on a wide variety of benchmarks, with stronger results after undergoing multitask prompted finetuning. To facilitate future research and applications using LLMs, we publicly release our models and code under the Responsible AI License.},\n	urldate = {2023-07-03},\n	publisher = {arXiv},\n	author = {Scao, Teven Le and Fan, Angela and Akiki, Christopher and Pavlick, Ellie and Ilić, Suzana and Hesslow, Daniel and Castagné, Roman and Luccioni, Alexandra Sasha and Yvon, François and Gallé, Matthias and Tow, Jonathan and Rush, Alexander M. and Biderman, Stella and Webson, Albert and Ammanamanchi, Pawan Sasanka and Wang, Thomas and Sagot, Benoît and Muennighoff, Niklas and del Moral, Albert Villanova and Ruwase, Olatunji and Bawden, Rachel and Bekman, Stas and McMillan-Major, Angelina and Beltagy, Iz and Nguyen, Huu and Saulnier, Lucile and Tan, Samson and Suarez, Pedro Ortiz and Sanh, Victor and Laurençon, Hugo and Jernite, Yacine and Launay, Julien and Mitchell, Margaret and Raffel, Colin and Gokaslan, Aaron and Simhi, Adi and Soroa, Aitor and Aji, Alham Fikri and Alfassy, Amit and Rogers, Anna and Nitzav, Ariel Kreisberg and Xu, Canwen and Mou, Chenghao and Emezue, Chris and Klamm, Christopher and Leong, Colin and van Strien, Daniel and Adelani, David Ifeoluwa and Radev, Dragomir and Ponferrada, Eduardo González and Levkovizh, Efrat and Kim, Ethan and Natan, Eyal Bar and De Toni, Francesco and Dupont, Gérard and Kruszewski, Germán and Pistilli, Giada and Elsahar, Hady and Benyamina, Hamza and Tran, Hieu and Yu, Ian and Abdulmumin, Idris and Johnson, Isaac and Gonzalez-Dios, Itziar and de la Rosa, Javier and Chim, Jenny and Dodge, Jesse and Zhu, Jian and Chang, Jonathan and Frohberg, Jörg and Tobing, Joseph and Bhattacharjee, Joydeep and Almubarak, Khalid and Chen, Kimbo and Lo, Kyle and Von Werra, Leandro and Weber, Leon and Phan, Long and allal, Loubna Ben and Tanguy, Ludovic and Dey, Manan and Muñoz, Manuel Romero and Masoud, Maraim and Grandury, María and Šaško, Mario and Huang, Max and Coavoux, Maximin and Singh, Mayank and Jiang, Mike Tian-Jian and Vu, Minh Chien and Jauhar, Mohammad A. and Ghaleb, Mustafa and Subramani, Nishant and Kassner, Nora and Khamis, Nurulaqilla and Nguyen, Olivier and Espejel, Omar and de Gibert, Ona and Villegas, Paulo and Henderson, Peter and Colombo, Pierre and Amuok, Priscilla and Lhoest, Quentin and Harliman, Rheza and Bommasani, Rishi and López, Roberto Luis and Ribeiro, Rui and Osei, Salomey and Pyysalo, Sampo and Nagel, Sebastian and Bose, Shamik and Muhammad, Shamsuddeen Hassan and Sharma, Shanya and Longpre, Shayne and Nikpoor, Somaieh and Silberberg, Stanislav and Pai, Suhas and Zink, Sydney and Torrent, Tiago Timponi and Schick, Timo and Thrush, Tristan and Danchev, Valentin and Nikoulina, Vassilina and Laippala, Veronika and Lepercq, Violette and Prabhu, Vrinda and Alyafeai, Zaid and Talat, Zeerak and Raja, Arun and Heinzerling, Benjamin and Si, Chenglei and Taşar, Davut Emre and Salesky, Elizabeth and Mielke, Sabrina J. and Lee, Wilson Y. and Sharma, Abheesht and Santilli, Andrea and Chaffin, Antoine and Stiegler, Arnaud and Datta, Debajyoti and Szczechla, Eliza and Chhablani, Gunjan and Wang, Han and Pandey, Harshit and Strobelt, Hendrik and Fries, Jason Alan and Rozen, Jos and Gao, Leo and Sutawika, Lintang and Bari, M.

However, data encodes subjective content, which determines the possible outcomes of the models trained on it. Because such subjectivity enables marginalisation of parts of society, it is termed (social) `bias' and sought to be removed. In this paper, we contextualise this discourse of bias in the ML community against the subjective choices in the development process. Through a consideration of how choices in data and model development construct subjectivity, or biases that are represented in a model, we argue that addressing and mitigating biases is near-impossible. This is because both data and ML models are objects for which meaning is made in each step of the development pipeline, from data selection over annotation to model training and analysis. Accordingly, we find the prevalent discourse of bias limiting in its ability to address social marginalisation. We recommend to be conscientious of this, and to accept that de-biasing methods only correct for a fraction of biases.},\n	urldate = {2021-12-26},\n	author = {Talat, Zeerak and Lulz, Smarika and Bingel, Joachim and Augenstein, Isabelle},\n	month = jan,\n	year = {2021},\n	note = {arXiv: 2101.11974},\n	keywords = {Computers and Society, Artificial intelligence},\n}",

In this work, we survey 79 papers from the ACL anthology that mention race. These papers reveal various types of race-related bias in all stages of NLP model development, highlighting the need for proactive consideration of how NLP systems can uphold racial hierarchies. However, persistent gaps in research on race and NLP remain: race has been siloed as a niche topic and remains ignored in many NLP tasks; most work operationalizes race as a fixed single-dimensional variable with a ground-truth label, which risks reinforcing differences produced by historical racism; and the voices of historically marginalized people are nearly absent in NLP literature. By identifying where and how NLP literature has and has not considered race, especially in comparison to related fields, our work calls for inclusion and racial justice in NLP research practices.'\n}",

Typically, hate speech detection models are evaluated by measuring their performance on held-out test data using metrics such as accuracy and F1 score. However, this approach makes it difficult to identify specific model weak points. It also risks overestimating generalisable model performance due to increasingly well-evidenced systematic gaps and biases in hate speech datasets. To enable more targeted diagnostic insights, we introduce HateCheck, a suite of functional tests for hate speech detection models. We specify 29 model functionalities motivated by a review of previous research and a series of interviews with civil society stakeholders. We craft test cases for each functionality and validate their quality through a structured annotation process. To illustrate HateCheck`s utility, we test near-state-of-the-art transformer models as well as two popular commercial models, revealing critical model weaknesses."\n}',

In this paper, we argue that Dynabench addresses a critical need in our community: contemporary models quickly achieve outstanding performance on benchmark tasks but nonetheless fail on simple challenge examples and falter in real-world scenarios. With Dynabench, dataset creation, model development, and model assessment can directly inform each other, leading to more robust and informative benchmarks. We report on four initial NLP tasks, illustrating these concepts and highlighting the promise of the platform, and address potential objections to dynamic benchmarking as a new standard for the field.'\n}",

Owing to the popularity of the situational comedy (sitcom) genre, it contributes significantly to the over-all development of society. In an effort to analyze the content of television shows belong-ing to this genre, we present a dataset of dialogue turns from popular sitcoms annotated for the presence of sexist remarks. We train a text classification model to detect sexism using domain adaptive learning. We apply the model to our dataset to analyze the evolution of sexist content over the years. We propose a domain-specific semi-supervised architecture for the aforementioned detection of sexism. Through extensive experiments, we show that our model often yields better classification performance over generic deep learn-ing based sentence classification that does not employ domain-specific training. We find that while sexism decreases over time on average,the proportion of sexist dialogue for the most sexist sitcom actually increases. A quantitative analysis along with a detailed error analysis presents the case for our proposed methodology'\n}",
